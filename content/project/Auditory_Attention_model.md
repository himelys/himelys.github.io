In this project, we build auditory attention decoding model based on human brain signal recorded by EEG. Currently we have succeeded in building a linear models with more than 80% accuracy in detecting auditory attention of human. We are going to improve the trained decoder for real-time auditory attention decoding and try to apply the neural decoder to cognitive hearing aid system and telepresence robot system.
